Everything here is just a big hack. The proper way to list/manage
bookmarks is to use the mozilla nsINavBookmarksService and querying
places (http://mdn.beonex.com/en/Querying_Places). Implementing that
in conkeror itself would take too long, and doesn't solve the problem
I have at hand (to find my bookmarks), so querying the sqlite3 db will
do for now.
